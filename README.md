🏦 ATM Software Project

Hi! This is a simple ATM Management System I built using Java. The idea behind this project is to simulate how a real ATM works while keeping it easy to understand for learning and demonstration purposes.

✨ Features

Balance Inquiry – Check your current account balance instantly.

Cash Deposit – Add money safely to your account.

Cash Withdrawal – Withdraw money with balance validation.

Transaction History – View all your past deposits and withdrawals.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Java

🚀 Why I Built This

I wanted to strengthen my core Java skills by creating a project that mirrors a real-world banking scenario. This project helped me practice object-oriented programming, loops, and user input handling in Java.

💡 How It Works

Start the program.

Choose an option from the menu (Balance, Deposit, Withdraw, History, Exit).

Perform your transaction.

Exit safely when done.

This project is perfect for beginners learning Java and anyone who wants to understand the basics of banking application workflows.
